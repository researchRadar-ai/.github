# ResearchRadar.ai
### Your research. Now, with AI.

## Our inspiration
Every week, researchers invest significant time staying updated with the latest scientific publications. The painstaking process of searching for relevant papers diverts valuable time from their core research activities, potentially hindering scientific advancement. Over a year, this translates into considerable time and financial inefficiencies.

We believe that by leveraging artificial intelligence, our project can profoundly enhance the efficiency of this process. We have developed an AI-powered recommendation system that adeptly identifies and suggests high-quality, pertinent research papers.

Moreover, our system customizes its recommendations by analyzing each researcher's reading history, guaranteeing both relevance and significance. Notably, our platform delivers recommendations on a per-project basis. This means that even if a researcher is juggling multiple projects simultaneously, our recommendations remain distinct and organized, preventing any overlap or confusion.

## ResearchRadar.ai's Features:
- Using our AI-powered recommendation system, we help users find high-quality relevant papers.
- After a user finishes reading a paper, our system will recommend new research papers.
- Save research papers to a reading list.
- Search papers using the Metaphor API.
- See important keywords for each paper based on the YAKE Python library
- Annotate and view PDFs
- Create multiple projects to maintain an organized reading experience

## Tech Stack
AI-powered Recommendation system: We utilized the state-of-the-art ‚ÄúNeural Collaborative Filtering‚Äù algorithm through a Python library, which extends matrix factorization using a multi-layer perceptron. This approach enables us to recommend papers that align with the broader consensus of the research community.

Frontend: JavaScript, Chakra UI, React.js, Node.js

Backend: Python, Metaphor API, Microsoft Recommender library, PyTorch, Flask, YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor Python library), Git
